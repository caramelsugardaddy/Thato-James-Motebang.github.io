        <p1>Hello my name is Thato James Motebang and I am a student at CTU on a journey of countinous growth as a person as well as a software developer
            As a CTU student, I view problems as chances for progress, and I find inspiration in the different learning experiences available. My goal is to not just perform academically, but also to get a thorough understanding of my chosen area. Each discipline serves as a foundation for my overall development.
            <br>
            <br>
            My commitment extends beyond the classroom to extracurricular activities and community service. I recognize the importance of a well-rounded education and actively participate in projects that contribute to my personal development and feeling of community.
            I envision a future in which continual learning is integrated with my professional and personal interests, with a focus on creativity and adaptability. The knowledge and experiences gained at CTU will serve as a solid basis for the exciting road ahead. As I negotiate the rich fabric of education, my story is one of tenacity, passion, and an unyielding commitment to personal achievement.</p1>

        <h2 style="color: gold;">Skills</h2><br><br>
        My knowledge of computer architecture guarantees that I understand and optimize programs for maximum performance. To produce fast and effective programming solutions, I delve into the subtleties of computer system design, such as processors, memory, and input/output.
<br>
<br>
My web development talents are built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I excel in. I create visually beautiful, responsive websites using HTML for content structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. This ability ensures a smooth and interesting user experience.
<br>
<br>
My expertise in Python and diverse coding languages showcases my versatility. Python, valued for its simplicity, is just one tool in my expansive toolkit. From data analysis to software development, each language I command serves a unique purpose, allowing me to tackle diverse programming challenges.
    <br>
    <br>
    My current skills that I have achieved from courses contain: <br>
    -Cloud Fundamentals <br>
    -Computer Architecture <br>
    -Core Web Development <br>
    -Princeiples of Programme Design <br>
    -Programming with Python <br>
    -Robotics Development <br>

        <h2 style="color:gold;">Education and Work Experience</h2><br><br>
        During my high school years, I attended St. Francis College, where I laid the foundation for my academic journey. Following graduation, I pursued engineering at a technical and vocational education and training (T-VET) college, eager to delve into the world of technology. However, I soon discovered that my true passion lay in the realm of software development. Recognizing the need for a shift in my academic focus, I made the decision to redirect my career path. Now, I find myself at CTU, where I am wholeheartedly dedicated to honing my skills as a software developer. This educational journey has not only shaped my academic and professional pursuits but has also underscored the importance of aligning one's passion with their chosen field, motivating me to excel in the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of software development.
